## Buffomat Classic 2024.4.0

- [Druid] Do not /cancelform in moonkin form by adding `[noform:5]` to it.
- Minimap button is now using LibAce's standard library. Removed options for 
button rotation and distance, as they're now handled by the external library.
Clicking the button toggles the window, right clicking shows quick menu.
- [Bug] Remaining reference in code to minimapButton is removed

## Buffomat Classic 2024.3.0

- [SoD] [Shaman] Dual wield enchantments work again. Known problem: You can't

- [SoD] [Hunter] Heart of the Lion 10% stats aura

## Buffomat Classic 2023.11.4

  available in your bag will be eaten first (and a setting to choose lowest first).
  - New grouped buffs are marked with green text
  - New option (last in the "Scan Options") to prefer either highest available 
    item, or lowest. Lowest is useful when leveling, to consume your lowest level consumables first.
  - Clicking the icon in the buff list to print all items, which can provide this buff, from lowest to highest.
  - Added food eating auras to ignore list to hide the food buff task while eating, so it doesn't get eaten multiple times.
- [Known Bug] Soon after resurrecting under the flask effect, Buffomat can show a task for reflasking. It disappears a second or two later.
- In raid, staggered per-group updates now will skip empty 5man groups, which will result in faster updates overall.

- Hide consumables which have required level above player. If multiple items provide the buff, choose the lowest level
  requirement.

## Buffomat Classic 2023.11.0

- Updated the copy of KvLib for classic compatibility. Was using Windows directory Junctions before and that didn't go
  well.

  Classic.

  finding and fixing them.
- Crusader aura prompt will not pop up on the taxi or in a vehicle.
- Alchemist-only Flask of the North added

## Buffomat Classic 2022.11.0.2

- Ignore Priest Spirit buff and Mage Intellect buff, when Warlock Fel Intelligence is active
- [Bug] Respect MinBuff option (amount of missing buffs in party or on player
  to choose group buff)
- [Bug] Script error if MinBuff option is not set

## Buffomat Classic 2022.11.0

- In WotLK group buffs lost the ability to check whether an unit is within spell range. I am using single buff spell
  name for testing range which results in much shorter but still reliable range checks (30 yd instead of 100+). Keep in
  mind group buffs also check line of sight.

## Buffomat Classic 2022.10.4, 10.5

- Spell tab update is now hard limited in frequency to combat the raid lag.
- Buff scan update is also hard limited in frequency for the same reason.

  to be tested in real raid so will give it some time before promoting to

## Buffomat Classic 2022.7.5

- Throttled rebuild frequency of abilities/buffs tab to max 1 per second. This
  seems to have triggered lags in battlegrounds and raids. Being throttled at a
  wrong time means that we must update as soon as the throttle allows, so the update
  is performed asap after the cooldown window.

## Buffomat Classic 2022.7.4

- [WotLK] Rogue poison ranks updated
- Installing 7.2 or newer addon will also install a dummy addon named "BuffomatClassicTBC" which deactivates the old TBC

  Buffomat Classic TBC")

    - New class spell ranks
    - New elixirs
    - New food
    - New weapon enchantments

  even if they're checked.
- Skip mage Intellect buff if K'iru's Song of Victory is up in SWP or the island. Same for group buffs (Arcane
  Brilliance)

  properly, so on systems without other Ace3 addons it would blow up with a
  script error.

## Buffomat Classic and TBC 2022.2.4

- Using new tech now: AceAddon, AceConfig, and event handlers from Ace.
- Changed Spirit Tap setting to a slider, the previously set boolean value is
  now lost as the variable was renamed and became a percentage.

- Option to hide "Someone is drinking message", off by default, enable to hide.
- Option to disable Buffomat if priest's Spirit Tap talent is active (to
  maximize mana regen by preventing priest self-buffing after the combat). Off
  by default, click to enable (also please be a priest!).

  really work well.
